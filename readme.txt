This was a self-learning project I did with the help of YouTube tutorials and Google. Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with more complex SQL queries, SMSS, MS SQL Server, DAX functions, and Power BI. I have included several of the files necessary for anyone to replicate this project on their own if they so choose. The images folder contains all images I used for the dashboard, as well as several screenshots of the end-product.  

The dashboard is fully functional and updates in real-time based on the user's sorting preferences. You can click on any portion of a given graph or chart and that result will be highlighted. Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, Total Orders, and Average Pizzas Per Order will be auto calculated based on the Slicer filter at the top and/or the Date range selector. 

There are also Navigation Buttons which automatically bring the user to the desired dashboard. The first Dashboard labeled 'Home' - displays all the relevant data for both KPI and Chart requirements 1-5 as stated in the Problem Statement Tab of my notes. 

The 'Best/Worst Sellers' Dashboard displays information for Chart requirements 6 & 7.  

Also note the insights on the left of each Dashboard are different to reflect the data that is immediately present to the user. These insights are manually entered, however. One optimization I would hope to make in the future is to have these insights automated based on the current trend and/or sales date/category of pizza selected. I'm not sure if this is even a possibility, but it is something to consider. 

I have provided both the XLSX file and CSV for flat file data import into SMSS or any other DBMS tool of your choosing. Additionally, I created a Word document to track my SQL Queries, noting the requirements from the given Problem Statement, the queries themselves, and screen-prints of my results. These results were critical in comparing my Measures and Charts within Power BI, and gave me more confidence in knowing I was setting everything up correctly in accordance with the database. 

Lastly my OneNote file contains all my notes I documented throughout the process. There were some issues I ran into along the way which I noted down typically with (*) to let the reader know what they may expect in their creation of the dashboard. I included any solutions/workarounds to the problems and tried to make sure I was concise yet thorough. I would like to give a huge thanks to the Data Tutorials YouTube channel for providing this content and walkthrough of the process. 

P.S. CTRL-click on the Navigation buttons :)
